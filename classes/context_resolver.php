/**
 * Which pages may host an editable STACK input (#50).
 *
 * The editor extends STACK questions, not a module name. Whether a page carries a STACK input is
 * decided in the browser, where the rendered input either exists or does not; this class only
 * decides where the small bootstrap is worth loading, and which of those pages the plugin can
 * also resolve a question-bank context for.
 *
 * Two levels, deliberately separate:
 *
 *  - runtime: any page in the list below gets the editor, with per-question settings where they
 *    can be resolved and with the site defaults where they cannot. A module the plugin has never
 *    heard of is still usable.
 *  - configuration: resolving a course module, a question-bank entry, a capability and a return
 *    URL stays module specific and is only claimed for the modules that have been checked.
