/**
 * Guards the Jest definitions fixture against drift from the PHP definitions.
 *
 * The Jest suites test tex2max/max2tex with tests/jest/fixtures/definitions.json, an export of
 * definitions::export_for_js(). If a definition list changes and the fixture does not, the Jest
 * tests would silently keep testing the old behaviour. This test fails in that case.
 *
 * To regenerate the fixture after a deliberate change, run from the Moodle root:
 *   php local/stackmatheditor/tests/jest/export_definitions.php
