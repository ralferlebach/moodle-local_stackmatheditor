  As a course teacher
  I want to configure the MathQuill toolbar for individual STACK questions and entire quizzes

      | teacher1 | Teacher   | One      | teacher@example.com  |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |

      | activity | course | name      | idnumber |
      | quiz     | C1     | Test Quiz | quiz1    |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
