/**
 * Report configuration records that the old lookup could have mixed between quizzes (#68).
 *
 * Until 2026091502 the lookup had a layer that matched a question bank entry in any quiz, and a
 * second one on the old questionid column that was equally unscoped. Both are gone. This script
 * says what an installation actually holds, so that an upgrade does not have to guess:
 *
 *   - duplicates per (cmid, questionbankentryid), which the application deduplicates on write
 *     but the database does not forbid;
 *   - records of the old questionid kind, where that column still exists;
 *   - question bank entries configured in more than one quiz, which is legitimate and was the
 *     situation in which the removed layer used to leak.
 *
 * Read-only. It changes nothing and recommends nothing it cannot back up.
 *
 * Usage, from the Moodle root:
