Feature: tex2max converts LaTeX to Maxima notation correctly
  As a plugin developer
  I want the MathQuill editor to produce correct Maxima output for all supported constructs
  So that STACK questions receive syntactically valid CAS expressions

  # Tests drive the full UI path: MathQuill input -> tex2max -> hidden STACK input.
  # Requires a working STACK CAS (for quiz attempt rendering) and MathQuill init.
  # The plugin variableMode is configured per-quiz; tests use the default "explicit_single"
  # for operator-protection tests and "stack" for symbol/fraction tests.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student   | One      | student1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role    |
      | student1 | C1     | student |
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | maximacommand | maxima | qtype_stack |
      | castimeout    | 300    | qtype_stack |
    And the STACK CAS platform is reset to direct Maxima
    And the plugin enabled mode is set to "1"
    And a STACK quiz "Conversion Quiz" with algebraic input exists in "C1"
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I start the STACK MathQuill quiz attempt "Conversion Quiz"

  @javascript
  Scenario: "or" is not split into o*r in explicit_single mode
    When I enter latex "x=3 or x=6" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should contain "or"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should not contain "o*r"

  @javascript
  Scenario: "and" is not split into a*n*d in explicit_single mode

  @javascript
  Scenario: Regular fraction is not affected by mixed-fraction fix
    When I enter latex "\frac{1}{2}" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "(1)/(2)"

  # ── Pi notation (#31) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  @javascript
  Scenario: Pi is rendered as plain "pi" by default (usePercentPi off)
    When I enter latex "\pi" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "pi"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Pi is rendered as "%pi" when usePercentPi is enabled
    Given the plugin usePercentPi setting is "1"
    When I enter latex "\pi" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "%pi"

  # ── pm / ± expansion (#30) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  @javascript
  Scenario: Prefix pm produces two nounor alternatives with unary plus stripped
    When I enter latex "x=\pm 2" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "(x=2) nounor (x=-2)"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should not contain "x=+2"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Infix pm retains both plus and minus signs
    When I enter latex "a\pm b" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"

    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "(x=a+b-c) nounor (x=a-b+c)"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Minus-plus is the mirror image of plus-minus, without a unary plus (#49)

  @javascript
  Scenario: A unary pm inside parentheses keeps the parentheses
    When I enter latex "x=a\left(\pm b+c\right)" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"

    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should contain "(-b+c)"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should contain "nounor"

  # ── Square root (#39) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  @javascript
  Scenario: A square root next to plus/minus stays an atomic sqrt call
    When I enter latex "x=-\frac{p}{2}\pm\sqrt{\frac{p^2}{4-q}}" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should contain "sqrt((p^2)/(4-q))"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should not contain "s*q*r*t"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should not contain "\pm"

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: The shipped tex2max never splits sqrt, whatever the variable mode
    When the tex2max output for latex "a\sqrt{b}" in variableMode "<mode>" is evaluated
    Then the tex2max result should contain "sqrt(b)"

  # ── Identifiers containing an operator name (#58, #60) ───────────────────────

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: An operator name inside a longer identifier stays part of it
    When the tex2max output for latex "<latex>" in variableMode "stack" is evaluated
    Then the tex2max result should be "<expected>"

    And the tex2max result should not contain "asin"

  # ── Multi-character subscripts (#59) ─────────────────────────────────────────

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: A multi-character subscript is one identifier

  # ── Typed on the keyboard, not written through the API (#58) ─────────────────
  # The other scenarios drive MathQuill's write() API. These go through the typing
  # path, which is where an operator name inside a word was pulled out of it.

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: An identifier typed on the keyboard stays one identifier
    When I press the keys "<typed>" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "<expected>"
    And the MathQuill field for "ans1" should contain LaTeX containing "<latex>"

    Examples:
      | typed    | expected | latex    |
      | Umax     | Umax     | Umax     |
      | Umin     | Umin     | Umin     |
      | argmax   | argmax   | argmax   |
      | maximum  | maximum  | maximum  |
      | sinvalue | sinvalue | sinvalue |

  @javascript
  Scenario: A function typed on the keyboard is still a function
    When I press the keys "max(x,y)" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "max(x,y)"

  @javascript
  Scenario: A multi-character subscript typed on the keyboard stays one identifier
    When I press the keys "U_max" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "U_max"
    And the MathQuill field for "ans1" should contain LaTeX containing "U_{max}"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The subscript survives being written back into the editor
    When I enter latex "U_{max}" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "U_max"

  # ── An external script writes into the STACK input (#77) ─────────────────────
  # STACK's JSXGraph bindings do exactly this: they set the value and dispatch a
  # change event that does not bubble. The editor has to show the new value.

  @javascript
  Scenario: A value written from outside appears in the editor
    When the STACK input for "ans1" is set to "2" by an external script
    Then the MathQuill field for "ans1" should contain LaTeX containing "2"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "2"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The editor still writes back after an external change
    When the STACK input for "ans1" is set to "2" by an external script
    And I enter latex "3" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    Then the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "3"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Alternating changes do not drift
    When the STACK input for "ans1" is set to "2" by an external script
    And I enter latex "3" into the MathQuill field for "ans1"
    And the STACK input for "ans1" is set to "4" by an external script
    Then the MathQuill field for "ans1" should contain LaTeX containing "4"
    And the underlying STACK input for "ans1" should be "4"
