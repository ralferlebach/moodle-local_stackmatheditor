# CI helper: builds a disposable, fully installed Moodle site with qtype_stack and
# local_stackmatheditor for the Playwright, k6 and JMeter workflows.
#
# Run from the workspace root; the plugin checkout must be in ./plugin. The site ends up in
# ./moodle and is installed via admin/cli/install.php (a real site, not a test site), which is
# why ALL declared STACK dependencies must be present - install.php enforces them, whereas the
# PHPUnit/Behat initialisation of moodle-plugin-ci does not.
#
# Environment (all optional):
#   MOODLE_BRANCH (MOODLE_405_STABLE), MOODLE_WWWROOT (http://127.0.0.1:8000),
#   MOODLE_DATAROOT (/tmp/moodledata), DB_NAME/DB_USER/DB_PASS (moodle/moodle/moodle),
#   MOODLE_ADMIN_PASS (Admin!23), STACK_BRANCH (master), ADAPTIVEMULTIPART_BRANCH (master),
#   DFEXPLICITVAILDATE_BRANCH (master), DFCBMEXPLICITVAILDATE_BRANCH (master),
#   IMPORTASVERSION_BRANCH (main).
