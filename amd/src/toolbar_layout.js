/**
 * Where a toolbar group may break when the toolbar wraps (#74).
 *
 * Flexbox on its own breaks a group wherever the line happens to end, which turns a group of
 * seven buttons into rows of two and three and two - and a group that reads as three fragments
 * is no longer a group. The rule instead:
 *
 *   up to five buttons   the group never breaks; it moves to the next line as a whole
 *   six or more          the first three and the last three stay together, and only what lies
 *                        between them offers break points
 *
 * The decision is made here, in plain arithmetic, and the toolbar builder turns it into DOM.
 * That is deliberate: the rule is then visible in the markup and testable without a browser,
 * rather than hidden in nth-child selectors.
